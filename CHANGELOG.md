# Changelog

### WIP! This changelog file is not complete!

All notable changes to the Bogue project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/sanette/bogue/compare/20240225...HEAD)

### Developement

- Next version will use tsdl 1.0.0

## [20240225](https://github.com/sanette/bogue/compare/20231209...20240225)

### Warning: Last version compatible with tsdl < 0.9.9 (and >= 0.9.7)

### Added

- `Text_input.activate` is now public
- `Box.get_style` and `Box.set_style` are now public.

### Fixed

- Take advantage of recent SDL version to (greatly!) reduce power
  saving with idle.
- Fix too large cursor position when using Text_input.set

### Developement

- `mouse_at_rest` now uses `Timeout`.
- Switch from `directories` to `xdg` to work on Windows.
- Remove symlinks in doc.
- The `example.ml` file is now called `examples.ml`, which is much
  more logical since it contains more than 50 examples.
- Trying to enforce that all used submodules are aliased (to make it
  clear they are used) in the header of each file, example `module
  Time = B_time`.

## [20231209](https://github.com/sanette/bogue/compare/20221112...20231209)

  care for Windows OS.
